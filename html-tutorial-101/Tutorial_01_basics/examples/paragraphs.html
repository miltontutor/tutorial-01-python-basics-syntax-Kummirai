    <h1>Working with Paragraphs</h1>

    <p>This is a paragraph. HTML will ignore extra spaces and line breaks
        in the source code.</p>

    <p>This is another paragraph.
        Notice how even though there's a line break in the code,
        it appears as a single paragraph in the browser.</p>

    <p>If you need to force<br>a line break<br>within a paragraph,<br>use the &lt;br&gt; tag.</p>

    <p>This paragraph has multiple spaces between some words. HTML collapses multiple spaces into a single space.</p>
